											<h3>About</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Tony Penguin: Pipeline Pro was a team project that was created for a game development competition at Cal Poly Pomona’s Game Design and Development club. In this game, you play as Tony Penguin whose main goal is to traverse obstacle courses while wracking up as many points as he can before he hits the finish line. Perform 180 spins, ollies, and successful rail grinds to earn points. This game was heavily influenced by the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series.</p>

											<h3>Contribution and Obstacles Faced</h3>
										</header>
										<p>My role was to develop the rail grind system and create in-air player controls to support the player when he was off the ground in order to successfully strafe between rail lines. I programmed the rails in a way that the player would snap onto the rail if the skateboard’s base came into a close enough proximity. The player would then proceed to grind the rail in the direction that the player was generally heading. Also, I added a skill check for the player where they have to keep balance while grinding, otherwise they would fall off. To do this, I added a meter with a pointer that would increase and decrease randomly within the values of -1 and 1. The player  would try to counteract this by using the directional keys to keep the pointer centered and the board balanced.</p>
										<p>The biggest obstacle I faced was getting the player to grind along the rail no matter what angle the player came from and no matter what angle the rail was positioned at relative to the scene. It took continuous trial and error, as well as help from friends, til I eventually came up with an algorithm that would put the player along the right path. It turned out that Unity’s engine had unknown rules to its scene angle system that I eventually flushed out.</p>
