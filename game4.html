											<h3>About</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Ultimate Monster Coach Battle was a team project that was made during BeachHacks 2017 which was hack-a-thon held at  Cal State Long Beach. This is a PvP battle management game. Each player plays as “monster coaches” that manage each of their 3 fighters in separate arenas. Each fighter has elemental gloves that hold either fire, water, or nature elements. The damage that they output depend on the opposing fighter’s current element. It is structured like a rock-paper-scissors. The coaches’ job is to traverse the map, while avoiding traps left by the opposing coach, and provide their fighters with the correct element that will give them an edge in battle. The player who wins two out of three battles wins.</p>

											<h3>Contribution and Obstacles Faced</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I worked on the character controller for the coaches, the in game trap mechanics, main menu UI programming, and the implementation of character animations that were created by one of my teammates. The biggest part of this was creating the animation controller and setting the conditions for each individual animation including idling, walking, casting elements, and getting stunned by traps.</p>
										<p>The biggest obstacle I faced was a bug that kept a player stuck in the stun animation if the opposing player placed a trap while standing in the same spot. This problem was difficult because it was hard to pinpoint what was causing the issue. In order to fix it, I tried to re create the bug over and over again until I found a pattern and compared it to other instances where the bug did not appear. I finally came to the conclusion that it was a timing issue related to the creation of the trap and was able to resolve it.</p>
